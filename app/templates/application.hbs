      Hey Zoey, have you had a chance to look at the EmberConf brainstorming doc
      I sent you?

    <p>Hey!</p>

    <p>
      I love the ideas! I'm really excited about where this year's EmberConf is
      going, I'm sure it's going to be the best one yet. Some quick notes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Definitely agree that we should double the coffee budget this year (it
        really is impressive how much we go through!)
      </li>
      <li>
        A blimp would definitely make the venue very easy to find, but I think
        it might be a bit out of our budget. Maybe we could rent some spotlights
        instead?
      </li>
      <li>
        We absolutely will need more hamster wheels, last year's line was
        <em>way</em> too long. Will get on that now before rental season hits
        its peak.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let me know when you've nailed down the dates!</p>
